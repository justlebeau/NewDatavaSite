      <description>For those that don&#39;t work in education or aren&#39;t aware, there is a measurement for a child&#39;s reading level called a Lexile Â® Level. &amp;nbsp;There are ways in which this level can be retrieved using different reading assessments. &amp;nbsp;The measurement can be used to match a child&#39;s reading level to books that are the same level. &amp;nbsp;So the company maintains a database of books that they have assigned levels. &amp;nbsp;There are other assessments that measure how well a child is reading, but I&#39;m not aware of any systems that assign books as comprehensively.</description>
