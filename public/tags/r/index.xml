      <description>For those that don&#39;t work in education or aren&#39;t aware, there is a measurement for a child&#39;s reading level called a Lexile Â® Level. &amp;nbsp;There are ways in which this level can be retrieved using different reading assessments. &amp;nbsp;The measurement can be used to match a child&#39;s reading level to books that are the same level. &amp;nbsp;So the company maintains a database of books that they have assigned levels. &amp;nbsp;There are other assessments that measure how well a child is reading, but I&#39;m not aware of any systems that assign books as comprehensively.</description>

      <description>I created a Twitter account which was inspired by a couple Twitter accounts that applied a particular type of machine learning technique to learn how two (at the time) presidential hopefuls spoke. I thought, why not see what a model like this could do with lyrics from my favorite rock n roll artist?
Long short term memory (LSTM) is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that can be used to produce sentences or phrases by learning from text.</description>

      <description>*For R users not interested in the post but the code, a markdown file is available on github. Thanks to Zuguang Gu and Bob Rudis for the &amp;lsquo;circlize&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;waffle&amp;rsquo; packages respectively.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying Arabic for about 10 months now and had some thoughts that I wanted to post about. It&amp;rsquo;s challenging, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how challenging it was exactly when compared to other languages even though I knew it was on the more challenging end of the spectrum.</description>
