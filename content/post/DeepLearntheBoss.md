I created a Twitter account which was inspired by a couple Twitter accounts that applied a particular type of machine learning technique to learn how two (at the time) presidential hopefuls spoke. I thought, why not see what a model like this could do with lyrics from my favorite rock n roll artist?

Long short term memory (LSTM) is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that can be used to produce sentences or phrases by learning from text. A twitter account that inspired this [@deeplearnbruce](https://twitter.com/deeplearnbern) was [@deeplearnthebern](https://www.twitter.com/deepdrumpf) which use this technique to produce phrases and sentences.

I scraped a little more than 300 of his songs and have fed them to a LSTM model using R and the mxnet library. Primarily I used [mxnet](http://mxnet.io/) to build and train the modelâ€¦great site and tools. &nbsp;The tutorials on their site are very helpful and particularly [this one](http://mxnet.io/tutorials/r/charRnnModel.html)
