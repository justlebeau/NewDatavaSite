The dashboard tool provided by [myclassroomanalytics.com](https://myclassroomanalytics.com/) is designed to facilitate quick data analysis in an easy to use format.  Schools have a vast amount of data on their students yet few teachers have the time to analyze, interpret, and apply conclusions to their classrooms.

This dashboard is simple.  It accepts a widely used information format and requires few columns of information making it easy to access and use.

In addition the site contains other useful (and free) resources for the classroom, including a report builder for MAP testing.  The MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) testing system is an amazing tool for measuring student growth in certain subjects.  Their reporting system for the data also includes a variety of ways to understand student data and to make comparisons.  

If you are interested in using these reports for your teachers or accessing the dashboard tool, send us an email (link above) or visit the site link and we will be in touch shortly.
